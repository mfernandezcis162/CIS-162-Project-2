        <h1> About Us</h1>
        <img src="ship.jpeg" alt="ship">
        <p> Freighter Travel Service is a company that serves as a middle man between shipping companies who are in desparate need of workers but don't want to pay benefits and potential 
            travelers who otherwise could not afford the high travel costs required to vacation accross the globe. Don't worry this is perfectly "legal". Throughout our site, you will find instructions on how to qualify 
            and what kind of jobs you would perform. We hope to add more vacation destination as time goes on.
